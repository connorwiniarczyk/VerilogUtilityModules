## System Verilog Utility Modules

A utils file for System Verilog, contains a couple of generic modules that I found myself needing a lot during my digital circuits courses in school.

Currently contains:
- button debouncer
- level to pulse converter 
- clock divider
- binary counter
- periodic pulse generator
- binary to 1-hot decoder
- binary-coded-decimal to seven segment display decoder
